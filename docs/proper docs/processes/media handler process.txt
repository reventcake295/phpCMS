Handler: media
The media handler is for the handling of reqeusts for media files including uploads
The process goes as follwos:

Determine if url request exits in the url match list for media requests
	If match exits retrive match data and continue
	If no match exits return a 404 and exit the handler

One of the following cases happens depending on what the match data says
If match data says stored in secure media cahce, check access permission
	If permission granted, give the file to the web engine and exit the handler, if file does not exits see if it is contructible and then give the file to the web engine other wise retrun a 404, raise a error to the administrators and exit the handler
	If permission not granted return a 401 or 403 depending on the reason of no permission and then exit the handler

If the match data says it is an uplaoded file:
	check if file exits	
		if yes:
			check access permission
				If permisison granted: give the file to the web engine and exit the handler
				If permission denied: return a 401 or 403 depending on the the reason of permission denied and then exit the handler
		If no: return a 404 and then exit the handler

If match data says it is a custom built file:
	check access permisison
		If no: return a 401 or 403 depending on the the reason of permission denied and then exit the handler
		If yes:
			format the request data in accordance with the format stated in the match data
				If the format returns an incorrect, handle it as stated in the format, give the data as given by the error handling of the format to the web engine and then exit the handler
				If the format returns an correct with the data, call the executor referenced and then generate the file, follwoing that send the file to the web engine and then exit the handler
